    <h3 class="about">Hip Hop Icons</h3>
        <p class="intro">The music movement of Hip Hop can be tracked back to the Southern Bronx, in New York City during the 1970s. It was started by DJ Kool Herc and he was the man that laid the ground work for everything associated with Hip Hop today: the rhythmic beat, the scratching, the drum beats and the mixing. Out of these beginnings, there has risen a host of iconic legends. The new Hall of Fame Museum opens its doors in February 2018 and it will house a wealth of information on this genre.</p>
